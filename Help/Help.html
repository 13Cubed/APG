            <p>APG generates passwords with two (2) to eight (8) random common dictionary words. It displays length and approximate bits of entropy.</p>
            <h2><u>FAQ</u></h2>
            <h3>How many words are included in the default word list?</h3>
            <p>4,701</p>
            <h3>What is the origination of the word list?</h3>
            <p>This word list was obtained from Trinity College Department of Computer Science Cryptology Resources Index. Words less than 4 characters in length and contractions have been removed from the list included in APG.</p>
            <h3>Can I change the word list used by APG?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. Right-click on the APG app icon and choose <b>Show Package Contents</b>. Browse to <b>Contents</b> > <b>Resources</b> and replace the <b>Words.txt</b> file with your own. Most UNIX distributions, including OS X, have a built-in word list of approximately 250,000 words. That word list can be found here: <b>/usr/share/dict/words</b>.</p>
            <h3>If I replace the word list will the approximate bits of entropy listed still be correct?</h3>
            <p>APG will evaluate the total number of words in the word list (x) and then evaluate log2(x). The calculation is simply the number of words (n) * log2(x), taking into account the use of any separators.</p>
            <h3>What random number mechanism does APG use and how is it seeded?</h3>
            <p>APG uses the newer arc4random() function as opposed to rand() or random(). This function is self-seeding and uses a superior algorithm.</p>
